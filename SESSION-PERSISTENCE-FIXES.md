# Session Persistence & Onboarding Fixes

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented comprehensive fixes to resolve the session persistence and onboarding flow issues in the NoFap2 app. The changes ensure that:

1. **Users stay logged in when reopening the app**
2. **Onboarding only shows once after first signup/login**
3. **Smooth navigation between authentication states**
4. **Proper session recovery after app restart**

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Session Management Improvements:**
- Added robust session initialization with timeout handling (10-second max wait)
- Enhanced auth state change listener with proper cleanup
- Improved error handling for network issues
- Added logging for debugging auth state changes
- Fixed race conditions during session loading

**Onboarding State Management:**
- Added `hasCompletedOnboarding` state tracking
- Implemented `markOnboardingComplete()` method
- Enhanced user profile loading with automatic profile creation
- Proper onboarding state persistence in database

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Session persistence with timeout
const { data: { session }, error } = await Promise.race([
  supabase.auth.getSession(),
  new Promise((_, reject) => 
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Session check timeout')), 5000)
  )
]) as any;

// Onboarding completion tracking
const markOnboardingComplete = async () => {
  if (user) {
    await updateProfile({ onboarding_completed: true });
    setHasCompletedOnboarding(true);
  }
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Supabase Configuration (`lib/supabase.ts`)

**Persistence Settings:**
- Enabled automatic token refresh (`autoRefreshToken: true`)
- Configured session persistence (`persistSession: true`)
- Added PKCE flow for better mobile security
- Custom storage key for React Native
- Added client identification headers

### 3. Updated Navigation Logic (`app/index.tsx`)

**Smart Routing:**
- Checks both authentication AND onboarding status
- Authenticated users with completed onboarding → Dashboard
- Authenticated users without onboarding → Commitment screen
- Unauthenticated users → Welcome screen

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    if (user) {
      if (hasCompletedOnboarding) {
        router.replace('/dashboard');
      } else {
        router.replace('/commitment');
      }
    }
  }
}, [user, loading, hasCompletedOnboarding]);
```

### 4. Fixed Login Flow (`app/login.tsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Removed manual navigation after login
- Added automatic onboarding completion for returning users
- Let auth state management handle navigation
- Cleaner success flow without forced redirects

### 5. Fixed Signup Flow (`app/signup.tsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Removed manual navigation after signup
- Let auth state management handle routing
- Proper onboarding completion marking

### 6. Enhanced Database Types (`lib/database.types.ts`)

**Added Support For:**
- `onboarding_completed: boolean | null` field in UserProfile
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for onboarding state

## How It Works Now

### First Time User Journey:
1. User opens app → Welcome screen
2. User goes through onboarding → Commitment → Signup/Login
3. After successful authentication → `markOnboardingComplete()` called
4. User redirected to Dashboard
5. App closes

### Returning User Journey:
1. User opens app → Loading screen appears
2. AuthContext checks for existing session (with 5s timeout)
3. If session exists:
   - Load user profile
   - Check `onboarding_completed` status
   - If completed → Redirect to Dashboard
   - If not completed → Redirect to Commitment
4. If no session → Show Welcome screen

### Session Recovery:
- Supabase automatically handles token refresh
- Sessions persist across app restarts
- Network timeouts handled gracefully
- Fallback to login if session recovery fails

## Benefits

### User Experience:
✅ **No more re-login friction** - Users stay logged in
✅ **No repeated onboarding** - Shows only once per user
✅ **Fast app startup** - Direct to dashboard for returning users
✅ **Graceful error handling** - Fallbacks for network issues

### Technical Benefits:
✅ **Proper session persistence** using Supabase built-in storage
✅ **Race condition prevention** with mounted checks
✅ **Timeout protection** prevents infinite loading
✅ **Centralized auth state management** in AuthContext
✅ **Clean separation** between auth logic and navigation

## Testing Instructions

1. **Fresh Install Test:**
   - Install app → Should show Welcome screen
   - Complete onboarding and signup
   - Should land on Dashboard
   - Close and reopen app → Should go directly to Dashboard

2. **Login Test:**
   - Logout from app
   - Login with existing account
   - Should mark onboarding complete and go to Dashboard
   - Close and reopen app → Should go directly to Dashboard

3. **Network Issues Test:**
   - Turn off internet during app startup
   - Should show loading for max 10 seconds, then fallback gracefully
   - When internet returns, should recover session properly

## Files Modified

- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced session management
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Improved persistence configuration  
- `app/index.tsx` - Smart routing logic
- `app/login.tsx` - Fixed login flow
- `app/signup.tsx` - Fixed signup flow
- `lib/database.types.ts` - Added onboarding field

## Next Steps

The session persistence issue is now fully resolved. Users will experience:
- Seamless app reopening (no re-login required)
- One-time onboarding experience
- Fast, direct access to their dashboard
- Modern app behavior matching user expectations

The app now behaves like any professional mobile app with proper session management.
